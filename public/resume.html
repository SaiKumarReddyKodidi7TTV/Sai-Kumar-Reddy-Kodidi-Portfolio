 Reduced production defects by 42% by establishing comprehensive BDD test automation frameworks using Cucumber, 
JUnit, WireMock for service mocking & Cypress for end-to-end UI regression testing across financial workflows.
 Deployed modular microservices using Java 17, Spring Boot 3.x, Hibernate and JPA, seamlessly integrating with 
PostgreSQL for transactional data and MongoDB for unstructured customer analytics in fintech payment systems.
 Developed high-performance trading dashboards using React.js 18, Redux Toolkit, Next.js and Tailwind CSS, 
integrating Axios for REST API calls with secure token-based authentication for real-time trade visibility.
 Implemented event-driven architecture with Kafka Streams and RabbitMQ, enabling low-latency processing of FX rate 
feeds and high-volume equities order book updates with guaranteed message delivery and error handling.
 Containerized microservices using Docker, managed with Helm charts and orchestrated production-grade deployments 
on AWS EKS, achieving near-zero downtime and 99.99% service availability.
 Automated cloud infrastructure provisioning using Terraform on Azure, incorporating best practices in Infrastructure 
as Code (IaC), while supporting robust CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions and Jenkins for faster releases.
 Maintained PCI DSS compliance by enforcing strict security policies including AES-256 data encryption, HTTPS/TLS 
transport security, tokenization and centralized audit logging across all critical financial services.
 Versioned schema migrations using Liquibase, integrated with CI/CD to enable traceable changes and safe automated 
rollbacks during deployment failures, ensuring database consistency across environments.
 Conducted SWOT and risk impact assessments to proactively mitigate fintech-specific challenges related to latency, 
throughput, security breaches and cross-system reconciliation discrepancies.
